# Community-Owned Solar Energy Trading

## Project Description

A decentralized blockchain-based platform that enables peer-to-peer solar energy trading within local communities. This smart contract system allows solar panel owners to sell their excess energy directly to neighbors, creating a transparent, efficient, and community-driven energy marketplace.

The platform eliminates traditional energy intermediaries, reduces costs, and promotes renewable energy adoption by providing fair compensation to solar energy producers while offering competitive prices to consumers.

## Project Vision

To create a sustainable, decentralized energy ecosystem where communities can:
- **Achieve Energy Independence**: Reduce reliance on centralized power grids
- **Promote Green Energy**: Incentivize solar panel installation and renewable energy use
- **Foster Community Cooperation**: Enable neighbors to support each other's energy needs
- **Ensure Transparency**: Provide clear, immutable records of all energy transactions
- **Democratize Energy Trading**: Give individuals control over their energy production and consumption

## Key Features
